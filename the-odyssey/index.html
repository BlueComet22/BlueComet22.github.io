        <p>
          The Odyssey is a epic poem of returning and hubris, of the travels of the king Odysseus after the 10 years he spent 
          fighting in the Trojan War to return to his wife's side in Ithaca. While it's believed by many that these locations are 
          merely fictional, for now, let's attribute the places that he had to visit a modern-day location.</p>
        <p> After meeting the lotus-eaters in what is theorized by some to be in Lybia, Odysseus found himself and his crew in modern-day 
          Sicily, the land of one-eyed monsters called the cyclopes. Finding a cave  with more food than they could hope for, they remained 
          there for a short time—but little did they know—</p>
        <p> |<i>Polyphemus image</i>| </p>
        <p> —This was the cave where the cyclops Polyphemus, son of Poseidon, lived, and Polyphemus had little intention of letting a nice 
          snack leave. 
        </p>
        <p>They were trapped in the cave with a man-eating monster now, and they didn't have many options outside of being eaten alive. 
          But! Our tactician had a plan! Calling himself "Nobody," he filled Polyphemus with wine—</p>
        <p> |<i>stabbing image</i>| </p>
        <p>
          And stabbed him in the eye. It's the perfect escape opportunity. But not before a bit of gloating and revealing his true name 
          on the way. This, of course, totally won't backfire. And by that, I mean that, now knowing Odysseus' name, Polyphemus was able 
          to call on his father to curse Odysseus trip home to last another 10 years.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="script">

        <p>
          As Odysseus' home, Ithaca, came into view upon the horizon. Something happened. The bag of winds that he had acquired from the 
          keeper of the winds was opened up by his crew, shooting them all the way back to a different part of modern-day Sicily! 
          And, unfortunately, their trip this time around from Sicily to Ithaca will not be smooth sailing. After their ship count was 
          reduced to just one, they managed to find themselves at Aeaea, or a part of the modern-day west coast of Italy, where the witch-goddess 
          Circe lived.
        </p>
        <p> |<i>Circe image</i>|</p>
        <p>
          Because he had a herb that makes him immune to Circe's magic, half of the crew, not including him, were turned into pigs by Circe's 
          magically drugged food. While Odysseus was able to get Circe to turn his crew back into humans, Odysseus was seduced by her, and they 
          ended up staying there for a year.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="script">

        <p>A year passes, and, at the end of that year, he meets a prophet who tells him that none of his crew should eat the sacred cows of 
          Helios on Thrinacia or else Odysseus would lose all of his crew and his ship. Following that, Circe finally directs Odysseus towards the 
          way home, giving him food and drink for his journey and detailing on what to avoid. However, even that was not without its troubles.</p>
        <p>Sirens, bird-women whose songs were who urged all listeners to come to them, leaving them fated to drown in the oceans, the sea monsters 
          on either side of this very strait—Scylla, a man-eating monster with six heads on one side, and Charybdis, a monster who created dangerous 
          whirlpools on the other– luckily only lost 6 men rather than his entire crew and his ship</p>
        <p>The good news doesn't last, however. As, where do they end up other than Thrinacia, modern day Republic of Malta, and the very place 
          where the sacred cattle of Helios are said to be. And with his crew keen an going there, tempting fate was unavoidable—so tempt fate they did. 
          After a long storm causes them to eat up all their food, what was left but to eat the cattle? And thus, the crew was cursed,— 
        </p>
        <p>—and as they continued toward Ithaca when the storm died down, Odysseus was shipwrecked, his crew killed and his ships destroyed just as the 
          prophecy foretold.</p>

          He found himself in Ogygia, modern day Othonoi and the home of the goddess Calypso. 
        </p>
        <p>
          |<i> Calypso image</i>|
        </p>
        <p>
          Calypso falls in love with Odysseus, offering him immortality which he rejects, and holds him captive for 7 years despite him deeply missing 
          home and his wife. It's only when Hermes, the god of travelling, arrives in autumn of the 7th year, that Calypso lets Odysseus free; she gives 
          him a raft, food, clothing, and specific instructions on how to return home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Odysseus was told "to make his way over the sea, keeping the Bear on his left hand." Let's activate what he's said to have seen. Looking up 
          into the sky, we see in the sky, as described: the "late-setting Bootes," Pleiades, and a Bear that looks at Orion; a sight that is very much 
          similar to what Odysseus would have seen centuries ago. That means it was eastward to Ithaca!
        </p>
        <p>
          Except. He gets shipwrecked again once Poseidon finds out that he's escaped. He manages to find himself in Scheria, now, modern day Corfu. 
          However, another shipwreck does not mean hope is lost, as the king, queen, and their daughter are more than willing to help! After recounting 
          his story to a bard and a group of others, the following night, he was given treasures and was taken back to Ithaca in secret.
        </p>

      <div class="script">

        <p>
          Finally..., after 10 long years, he finally reaches the shores of Ithaca, no more gods to stop him from getting there and the curse ended. 
          While the trials of Odysseus don't quite stop there, this concludes his ten year journey from the battlegrounds of the Trojan War. A very 
          long journey indeed; one that makes it that much sweeter to finally return to his wife, Penelope's, side.
