          We start off our tour in the mountains of Italy. These mountains are where Galileo Galilei discovered
          many things as an astronomer in our skies. |<i>show journal image</i>| There are a great number of stars in the sky, and while
          Galileo was looking at them through his telescope, there was <b>one "star"</b> that acted differently from
          all the others, and that star was <b>Jupiter</b>.
          Have you ever looked up at the sky and wondered how us humans discovered those celestial bodies
          and who's been doing it all this time? Since before written history, we've studied the stars
          for thousands of years.
        </p>
        <p>Today, we'll be looking at the discoveries of Galileo Galilei, who found four huge moons of
        Jupiter from right here on Earth with his telescope.</p>

          This is Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. When we zoom out..., we see that Jupiter
          is so large that we can barely see the Galilean Moons we'll be talking about. So, let's make them
          bigger...
          The moons that we will be looking at today are called the Galilean Moons. These are Io, Europa, 
          Ganymede, and Callisto.
        </p>
        <p> <b>Io, Europa, and Ganymede are a special set</b> of moons out of these four that have a specific 
          connection called <b>“orbital resonance”</b>, one where their orbits happen at set intervals compared 
          to each other, where when Io orbits Jupiter four times, Europa orbist Jupiter twice, and Ganymede once. 
        </p>
        </p>
          Let's <b>test out</b> this orbital resonance for ourselves, shall we? When we see Io reach the top of
          it orbit, I want the left side of the room to clap. When Europa reaches the top of its orbit, I want the
          right side of the room to clap. Now, let's practice. The left side for Io... ...Good.
          The right side for Europa... ...Good.
          Now let's do it all together...
          There, now we've seen theis orbital resonance for ourselves! This 1:2:4 orbital resonance plays a big role 
          in some aspects of these moons. Now let's make these moons smaller so we can visit them.</p>

          Let’s start with the one closest to Jupiter and the one that looks the most different with its 
          colors.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Do you see all of those dark spots here? Those are spots caused by the volcanic activity on Io, 
          and there <b>hundreds of active volcanoes</b> on it, especially for its size, which is 3.5x smaller 
          than Earth. |<i>show image of volcanoic eruptions here, probably</i>| Which may lead you to ask, 
          ‘Why does it have so many volcanos?' That is where orbital resonance comes into play. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Tidal forces affect all of the planets and moons because of the masses of what they orbit around. On
          Earth, the tidal forces of the moon causes <b>high and low tide</b>, and that difference in height is
          60 feet, about the length of a bowling lane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orbital resonance, on the other hand, creates huge tidal forces on Io that are so strong that it doesn't 
          just <b>move water 60 feet</b>, but it moves <b>solid ground 330 feet</b>! That's just a bit taller than 
          the Statue of Liberty by 25 feet.
        </p>

          To our next moon on our path from Jupiter is another one with a different color than what you’d 
          expect. This is Europa. It looks rather white, doesn't it? Its white coloring is all due to water
          ice <b>that's 10 miles deep</b>. The marks on its surface are from tidal forces acting on it. It causes
          the ice to shift and crack thanks to <b>something important underneath</b>--water, a huge <b>ocean</b> in fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The significance of this lies with our exploration for <b>extraterrestial life</b>, or aliens. As we know, liquid
          water is a vital part of sustaing life as we know it. While we won't be finding little gray or green men (rather, 
          we'd find microscopic life) and we haven't found any other life yet, based on what we know about Europa and about 
          what's needed for life, scientists have high hopes that if there's any celestial body with with some sign of life 
          on it in our solar system, Europa is of the <b>most promising</b>. 
          And if we <i>do</i> find extraterrestial life, it would be a huge step, indicating that
          with the right ingredients, we life can exist throughout the universe beyond Earth. And with <b>plumes of water</b> 
          spouting through Europa's cracks out into space <b>100 miles high</b>..., as you can see in this image, we may even be 
          able to capture some of its oceanic water to study. As a result, Europa is a very popular moon often talked about 
          by scientists.

        <p>
          Next on our tour of Galilean moons is Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter’s moons and the largest moon in our 
          solar system; a big title indeed. It’s even <b>bigger than Mercury</b>, one of the 8 planets in our solar 
          system. Ganymede is also the only moon in our solar system with a <b>magnetic field</b>, which certain planets 
          like Earth have that let us see the aurora borealis, for example. 
        </p>  
        <p>
          The way this magnetic field and Ganymede’s <b>aurorae</b> shift showed us one important thing about the planet it’s 
          believed that underneath the moon’s crust is <b>an ocean</b>, too, an ocean deeper than Europa’s and maybe even 
          the largest in the whole solar system. However, this ocean is thought to be <b>95 miles deep instead of 
          10 miles,</b> so it would be much harder than Europa to get to; even then, there’s still the possibility of 
          life on Ganymede too. After all, one of the most important things needed for life is liquid water.

        —Callisto. Of the four Galilean Moons, Callisto is not involved in orbital resonance with the other three 
        moons, meaning that it doesn’t have to deal with as strong tidal forces. Once considered to be a completely 
        uneventful moon, Callisto is Jupiter’s <b>second largest moon</b> and the third largest in our solar system. Look at
       all of those <b>white spots</b> on its surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those spots are believed to all <b>craters capped with ice</b>, coming from impact spots on its icy surface from 
        whatever comets and asteroids that may have hit it, going as far back as <b>4 billion years ago</b>. It’s 
        considered the oldest and most cratered surface in our solar system. And, it may be that Callisto, despite 
        its appearances, has an ocean underneath its surface as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        That’s a three-for-four ‘water underneath the surface’ scenarios. That sounds like there may be a lot of 
        hope for alien life yet when we get some water samples from their oceans.

          And those four diverse moons are the moons that were seen by Galileo through his telescope <b>410 years ago</b>.
          While he <b>couldn’t see any of the details</b> of these four moons that we’ve seen today through his telescope, 
          his astronomical discoveries using his telescope has lead us to many great discoveries and led us to develop the
          telescopes to what we have today. And with their power and improvements, as of now in 2022, we've discovered <b>79</b>
          of Jupiter's moons. The moons we discover here <b>continue to grow</b> every year with many angles and orbits...
          [...]
          Even farther out into the universe, we've discovered <b>hundreds of exoplanets</b>, each of these stars <b>housing its own
          solar systen</b>. And as we further our explorations in space, our hunt continues, and perhaps soon, we'll find moons
          on the exoplanets beyond.
